									<h3> JOSE RIZAL &nbsp; to &nbsp; TRINIDAD RIZAL </h3>
									  <p>&emsp;&emsp;My dear sister Trining,</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Only today the boat arrived. We received all that you sent us and your letter tells me that the sickness that you had did not last long.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;All of us here miss you and many are asking when you are coming back. I believe that if you wish to come, you can do it by staying some months. You can engage in some business to distract you and at the same time to compensate you for your traveling expenses. If you wish to come, you can bring along Antonino.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;The patients are here. The old man lives in the round house with his son. Sra. Manuela (Orlach) lives with us.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;The dam that I am having built is paralyzed for lack of lime, but it is already very high. There are 14 boys at home and there is one more who lies to come. (1)</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;We are sending you fish, cacao, etc. in a box.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Sra. Maria is very well, but Puence, (2) constantly crys and keeps this poor one very busy. He no longer amuses us with his nose or his eyes as when you were here.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Send us sago (an edible palm starch).</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Morris (2) now knows how to read very well and speaks Spanish.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Ever since you left few young men and women come, but on Sundays there are always magugubot.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;We have already caught the sikop and the large iguana. The Subano hen hatched again the mountain eleven chicks, which until now are all well and complete. I have killed a young hen, because it was always climbing to the top of the bed.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Pastora's (3) cousin has been operated on and is well. A rich woman of Dipolog came but, as she introduced herself as a poor woman, I charged her only 5 pesos for the operation.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;The deaf cannot be operated on for neither does he sleep nor stay quiet.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Tell Nanay that that of Europe cannot be. (4) The daughter-in-law from Europe is about to be married, according to what my friends tell me. So that nothing from there.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Have a little patience; I cannot send you anything now, for there is much tintin.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;The boys are wishing that you come back.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;The boys are wishing that you come back.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Tell Tone to send me half a dozen tableware pieces like those he sent before for 3.50 pesos.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;[I send] many regards to all, to those at home, to Mr. Hino, (5) etc.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Your brother who loves you dearly,</p>
