									<h3> JOSE RIZAL &nbsp; to &nbsp; TEODORA ALONSO RIZAL </h3>
									  <p>&emsp;&emsp;My dear mother,</p>

								       <p>&emsp;&emsp;I received your letter of 14th instant and I understand perfectly your and Father's fears about my going to Cuba; however, as you say, we should have faith in God. Until now He has saved me from all dangers; why will He not save me from others in the future? I have therefore reiterated my request to serve in Cuba in view of the fact that I have not received a reply to my first.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;If you hear nothing about my departure, I should like you to buy me a second-hand bicycle, neither very bad nor very good and which would not cost more than 100 pesos. Pepe Leyva could do me the favor of buying one to use in my trips to town; it should be neither very good nor very bad. In the next mail, I'll send you the money together with another 100 pesos for Father and you.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;You'll receive from Capiz 50 pesos and another 10 pesos from Zamboanga, being fees paid by several patients of mine. I have money here but I have no means of sending it to you.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;If Schadenberg and also Mr. M. de los Reyes present new bills, please pay them. I'll pay you afterward.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Many thanks for the ham, wine, butter, etc. which we have received.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Through this boat I'm sending a box that contains.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;1 American balance that I'm presenting to Sr. Paciano.<br>
								      &emsp;&emsp;1 sack of cacao for you there.<br>
								      &emsp;&emsp;2 bottles of lard, 1 for you and the other for Sra. Sisa (without failure)<br>
								      &emsp;&emsp;2 bottles of pickles for you (1 for Sra. Sisa, without failure).<br>
								      &emsp;&emsp;1 roll of snamay for Trining.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Please send without failure to Sra. Sisa the lard and bottle of pickles. You may give away as you please the other bottles of pickles.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;The material for pantaloons, which you sent me, was sold very well at one peseta a yard; so that if you can send other textiles like that or better ones, with their prices, we can do a little business here. I'm not sending you honey now because the demijohn is not Yet full.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;If you would like to buy a lot, tell me the size you need and I'll look for one. If I don't leave this place, I'm thinking of buying a coconut plantation of more than 4,000 trees for 1,500 pesos, all about 4 or 3 years old. I hope my brother could give me money after the sale of the sugar. I believe it is good business. For the erysipelas of Mr. Hino, I would recommend three grams of boric acid in 100 grams of water for washing it.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Through the next mail, as I have told you, I'll send you a little money. I have many patients but many are gratis.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;On the 8th of this month Mr. Cosme gave a dance in the Casa Real that I attended. There were games, etc. etc.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;I kiss your hand and that of my good old father and wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Your son,</p>

								      <p><img src="../../images/sign.png" style="width: 20%;" /></p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;The box needs no bill of landing. Just see the purser and ask for the box marked T. A. The 100 pesos also go along with it.</p>

      									<p>&emsp;&emsp;Give 6 pesos as a Christmas gift to my godson Antonio Lopez.</p>
