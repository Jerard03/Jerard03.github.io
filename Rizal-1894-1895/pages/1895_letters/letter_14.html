									<h3> JOSE RIZAL &nbsp; to &nbsp; TEODORA ALONSO REALONDA </h3>
									  <p>&emsp;&emsp;My dear Nanay,</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;My sister Sra. María has arrived here and I am very sorry that she has made a useless trip. She returns bringing you 50 pesos that I have been able to save. You may buy with it cloth remnants and rice cakes for your little grandchildren and other things that you like.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Miss Bracken who has been behaving towards me better than I expected, is leaving now and though she tells me that she is coming back, I do not believe that she will decide to do so afterwards, because this is a very lonely place and everything is lacking here. I shall be alone then, entirely alone; my company will be my patients and the boys.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Sra. Maria is bringing you also the valise that you made, for I do not want it to be spoiled here. Your grandchildren ought to take care of it as a remembrance of their grandmother.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Tell Tatay not to worry about every piece of news he hears about me. I'm in the hands of God and if He does not save me, neither can you do it. Please do not send anybody any more here, for that is too risky, too tiresome, and too expensive. Do not believe that I have died because people say so.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Send me seeds of kasay, chico, ciruelas, cacauate, rimas, duhat, tampoy, iba, etc.; all can be placed in a box with sawdust.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;My trees are full of fruits; the lazon trees are adorned with flowers and if they all become fruits; the branches will break down. The papaya trees that were near the hexagonal house were crashed by a strong wind. However, we have abundant papayas that make me think of you always. When there shall be plenty of lanzon, I shall send them to you dried. I do not know if the nangka can reach there.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;With nothing more. I kiss your hand as well as my father's. With much love to my nephews and sisters [I remain],</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Your son,</p>
