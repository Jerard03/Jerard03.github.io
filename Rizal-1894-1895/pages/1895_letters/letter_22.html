									<h3> JOSE RIZAL &nbsp; to &nbsp; TEODORA ALONSO RIZAL </h3>
									  <p>&emsp;&emsp;My dearest mother,</p>

								       <p>&emsp;&emsp;I received your affectionate letter and I answer it at once.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;With respect to your appearance before the captain general, frankly, though I appreciate it, I cannot advise it. You have to trouble yourself a great deal, going, coming, waiting, and for what? Perhaps [it is only] to receive a refusal. I do not want you in your old age to be exposed to more displeasures. I have written again now to His Excellency asking for my freedom or to the review of my case. I ask also for my enlistment as physician in the army of Cuba. (1) Blumentritt advised me to do so and I believe he is right.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;I was unable to pay the freight of the goods because the supercargo told me he didn't know it. You don't tell me if you have received the honey and the durians.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;By this mail boat I send you 150 pesos; the 30 pesos must be given to Trining as payment from Rommy's mother. I issued a receipt to them. The 120 is for you and Tatay (Father) after deducting the cost of my orders and those of persons here.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;One box of cheap tableware<br>
								      &emsp;&emsp;One tin of tea (Calle Nueva)<br>
								      &emsp;&emsp;15 cavanes of salt.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;You collect a commission of 5% for your expenses in addition to the expenses of cartage, for here I shall not collect a single cent.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;My orders are reduced to</p>
								     
								     	<p>&emsp;&emsp;2 toothbrushes <br>
								     	&emsp;&emsp;1 ball of twine for sewing shoes.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Please pay my bills with Schadenberg.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;[I send] my felicitations to Pepe on his triumph in cycling.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;[I give] many thanks to Ñor Gino for the seeds, sausage, and sweets.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;When you want to come, please know that you will be received, as a loving mother deserves to be received.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;I congratulate my brother on his new purchase. What a pity that I can't help him in his new purchase. What a pity that I can't help him in his planting. I would be very glad to see him if I shall still be here.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;I'm very much pleased with the dishes and tumblers as well as the two bolts of dimity.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;The half arroba (2) of chocolate that I received by the previous mail boat came from a patient of mine.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;The new commandant that we have is very winsome and it seems we shall become very good friends, indeed, true friends. (3)</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;If the sugar is sold and you want to buy a house in Meisik, you can dispose of the little money I have there which I give to you and my father for your whims and fancies.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;With nothing more for the present, with regards to all, I kiss affectionately your hand and father's.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Your son who loves you sincerely,</p>

								      <p><img src="../../images/sign.png" style="width: 20%;" /></p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Get the money from the boat, showing this letter.</p>

									  <p>&emsp;&emsp;He does not want his mother to appeal to the governor general for his freedom -- He has written him again -- He has applied for enlistment in the army as a physician -- Sends his parents some money -- The new politico -- Military commander.</p>

     								<p>&emsp;&emsp;(3) Captain Rafael Morales, cultured gentleman who spoke several languages; but he held the post for only a short time, for he was promoted to major. Ricardo Carnicero, the same one who was there in 1892, took his place.</p>
