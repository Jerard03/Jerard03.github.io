									<h3> JOSE RIZAL &nbsp; to &nbsp; TRINIDAD RIZAL </h3>
									  <p>&emsp;&emsp;My dear sister Trining,</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;I received your letter and I am informed of its contents. I am very glad that the fire only frightened you and nothing more. What I regret is the loss of the palasan (1) walking sticks for I have never seen better ones than those. Patience.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;I hope you will tell me when Tatay (Father) is coming, if he is coming, because I will prepare a part of my house for him.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Tell everybody to have more confidence in me and not to take me always for a child who has to be guided in everything, in what he must like and in what he must not like. If my family has no confidence in me and always treats me like a child, how will others treat me and what confidence will they have in my good judgment. I'm in the hands of God and until the present I have no reason to say that He has abandoned me. Let us do always our duty, what is right, and let Him do the rest. Let us not be hasty in our judgment, but let us think well of our fellowmen.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Sra. María carries the gold watch chain that you asked of me.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;How is the case of Champopo? (2) I am very much interested in knowing it because of Sra. Concha.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;They carry two jars of pickled mangoes.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Miss Bracken returns your regards very gratefully.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;By this mail I have written the governor general requesting him to permit my departure for Spain, because I am beginning to fill ill. I believe that I can no longer stand this life here -- much work, little nourishment, and no little displeasures.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Tell Pangoy to consider this letter hers.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;I send roosters and hens to Nanay (Mother), but I do not send sheep to Mr. Paciano, because what I have are very ugly and I do not know how they will eat during the trip. If he insists on having some, it would be better to buy them in Manila.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Do not forget to tell me about Tatay (Father).</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;In the state of mind in which I am I have not been able to finish the poem. (3) I need tranquility.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Your brother who loves you,</p>

								      <p><img src="../../images/sign.png" style="width: 20%;" /></p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Many regards to all -- Sra. Concha, Sra. Ticang, (4) Sr. Hino, etc.</p>

									  <p>&emsp;&emsp;(1) Pasalan is the popular Tagalog name for a very sturdy rattan found in Philippine forests. It is used for walking sticks.</p>
								     <p>&emsp;&emsp;(2) He was a Chinese grocery merchant who had a store on Nueva Street, Binondo, and who had a case in court concerning a loan guaranteed by Mrs. Concepción (Concha) Leyba that he could not pay or did not want to pay. (Note: OF Dr. Leoncio López Rizal, nephew of Rizal.</p>
								     <p>&emsp;&emsp;(3) He refers to the beautiful poem mi retiro that tells of his life at Dapitan.</p>
								     <p>&emsp;&emsp;(4) Vicente Leyba, sister of Concepción (Concha) Leyba.</p>
