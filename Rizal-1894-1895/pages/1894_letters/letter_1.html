									<h3> JOSE RIZAL &nbsp; to &nbsp; MANUEL T.  HIDALGO </h3>
									  <p>&emsp;&emsp;My dear brother-in-law Maneng,</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Although I have not yet received your letters, nor do I know if I have any of this mail, nevertheless I presume that nothing unpleasant has happened to you there. "No news is good news," say the English.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Enclosed I send you a request addressed to the governor general. (1) I do not send it directly to His Excellency, because as he is not there, I am afraid it may be lost in some corner anywhere. If Tatay were not as he is, he would be the most fitting person to present my request to Malakañang on behalf of his son, but I am afraid he may lose it. He is, moreover, very old and those trips can hurt him.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;I have thought of you, but you have much work; by brother is very busy and I say the same about Antonino. As to Silvestre, there is nothing to say; I do not believe he would like to do anything for me; he behaves towards me in a way that I do not believe I deserve. I do not know then how to proceed. In short, I leave to your good judgment to decide who ought to present this request.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Enclosed is a pan for a house with some suggestions. I should like to know from a contractor how much it would cost. I think that the father of M. Salvador (2) understands much about this.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Here we are all well, thank God. Our mother is already well.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;I have heard that Sra. Neneng is having a house built in Mainit. I am glad of it.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Command as always your brother-in-law who loves you truly.</p>

									  <p>&emsp;&emsp;Without letters or news -- Application for liberty borne by his brother-in-law -- Tatay (Father) ought to present it on behalf of his son -- House plan -- Consult M. Salvador's father about its cost.</p>

									   <p>&emsp;&emsp;(1) Rizal's petition for his freedom. In it he relates that he has been deprived of it without due process of law, without trial and for two years reduced to inactivity after having finished a costly medical course. See Epistolario Rizalino, IV, 193-194.</p>
     								   <p>&emsp;&emsp;(2) Moises Salvador.</p>
