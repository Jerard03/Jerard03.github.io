									<h3> JOSE RIZAL &nbsp; to &nbsp; MANUEL T.  HIDALGO </h3>
									  <p>&emsp;&emsp;My dear brother-in-law Maneng,</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;I have received your letters, I believe all, and I have read them and I have always answered them. If you do not receive my letters, it will be because either they are lost or they are too much, which amounts to the same thing.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;In fact there are racehorses here . . . but for racing here and for no more. They are not worth much either as horses or as value, for here they do not know how to take care of them or train them. Imagine the curry comb is unknown and there is not a stable anywhere. The horse looks for his own food in the fields and when needed for riding, he is caught with a lasso. Probably there may be better ones in the district of Misamis, for I know that the people there are fond of horses.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Until now I have not received a reply from the governor general.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;If you can find someone there who has a good treatise on the diseases of the ear, I request you to buy it for me and send it to me at the first opportunity. I have patients here. But you have to get the money from my funds of Trozo.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Here we are all well. Our house is being enlarged little by little.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;I do not know how Sra. Neneng and Silvestre are getting along with their ailments. I assure you that here my good luck brings me much success, though little money. The only ones who go away uncured are the tuberculosis patients in the third period with cavities and one who had fibrous tumors in the larynx who did not want to inhale chloroform. I have a desire to be there to attend to you.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;It is probable that I may represent here an association of abaca growers and then I shall need you for the sale there. If a commission of 5% is acceptable to you, let me know.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;With nothing more for the present, [I send my] affectionate regards to Sta. Neneng and many kisses to the children.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Your affectionate brother-in-law,</p>
