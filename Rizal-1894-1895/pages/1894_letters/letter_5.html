									<h3> JOSE RIZAL &nbsp; to &nbsp; MANUEL T.  HIDALGO </h3>
									  	<p>&emsp;&emsp;My dear brother-in-law Maneng,</p>

								        <p>&emsp;&emsp;I received your two letters together with Valentin Ventura's letter and the little box of eyeglasses or lenses for cataracts. Enclosed with this is a reply to Ventura and I should like you to send it through the same bearer that brought this letter.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;With regard to the partnership proposed by Sra. Neneng, I should be very glad of it. But I should like first to make this experiment in order to see if something is gained or lost. She may lose. I have given 1,000 pesos to a man here to buy abaca; the profit and loss will be divided equally. By this mail boat I am trying to send 150 bundles of abaca and copra to be sold to any foreign firm and after deducting the expenses and the capital, we shall divide the profit or the loss. This is our partnership. If she approves of this, I would like exceedingly that she send me 1,000 pesos.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;With regard to my return there, you decide what is convenient. If there are too many physicians there and I am not needed, it is all right that they leave me here. I shall be able to manage with the little that I earn here. If you think that with my specialization I can earn more there, then it would be better than I return. As to the rest, it is all a question of trying for some months.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;I have operated successfully on Mother for cataracts, inasmuch as she was able to see at once and very clearly. The healing was going to last three days, but encouraged by this, she did not want to follow my prescriptions and got up and went to bed by herself, went out to the service porch, removing and putting on the bandage, always telling me that nothing will happen to her, until her eye became inflamed, (she suspected that she received a blow during the night), and now she is very ill. I do not know if I can pull her out. The wound opened the iris and was ruptured and now she has an acute ophthalmia. Nothing can stop her, she reads, she goes out to the light, [and] she rubs her eyes. What is happening to her is incredible. Now I understand very well why one ought to be forbidden to treat members of his family.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;With nothing more for the present, [I send the] regards of Nanay and Trining to all of you and you command your brother who loves you.</p>

									  <p>&emsp;&emsp;Eyeglasses or lenses for cataract -- Rizal in business partnership with a man in Dapitan -- Invites his sister to engage in the abaca business -- He lets his family decide his return -- "If with my specialty I can earn more there, I will return to Manila." -- Operated on his mother for cataracts.</p>
									  <p>P.S. <br>
      									&emsp;&emsp; For the present, while Tonino is there, as he has offered himself first, I will make him abaca agent of the Dapitanos. We have learned here that you lost your daughter. [We send] our heartfelt condolences. One little angel more and one Filipino girl less.</p>
