									<h3> JOSE RIZAL &nbsp; to &nbsp; MANUEL T.  HIDALGO </h3>
									  	<p>&emsp;&emsp;My dear brother-in-law Maneng,</p>

								       <p>&emsp;&emsp;I have not received a letter from you in the last two mails and I know nothing about you there. His Excellency has not yet written me a word. It will not be useless for you to present yourself to him when he arrives there to remind him of my request.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;I do not know if I can bother you about a business that I have undertaken here. I know that you are devoted to scientific and speculative studies and for this reason I have not written you and I preferred to address myself to Antonino for being more accustomed to these business matters. But I have no doubt that you or Sra. Neneng must know there somebody who wishes to be an agent to sell abaca and copra. We have could give him from 3 to 5% of the sale. I have written to Antonino but he has his lands in Bay to attend to. If Sra. Neneng were not a woman, I would make her my agent. Within a few days I am going to order there unbleached cloth (some three bales) and when I send the abaca, I will order some 300 piculs (1) of rice, and in all these purchases and sales, the agent naturally has his commission. Excuse me then for making you this proposal, but as I know no one to whom to address myself, I am obliged to do so by necessity.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Here I have many patients, but the majority of them are poor. I earn something but not enough for the work done.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Heeding what they are asking me insistently from abroad, I have decided to prepare a dictionary of the Tagalog language, a work that I cannot finish unless you help me. You can save me the work of looking for words and give their explanation. I will take care of classifying them grammatically, look for their analogies in Malayan languages and give their equivalent in Spanish, English, French, and German. In that way we can produce a monumental work of the Tagalog language. I realize that in order to finish this work it is necessary to be in the bosom of Tagalism, but I trust that I shall soon be in your midst.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;With nothing more for the present, [I send] many regards from all here to you, Sra. Neneng, the children, etc.</p>

								      <p>&emsp;&emsp;[I am] your brother-in-law who loves you.</p>
